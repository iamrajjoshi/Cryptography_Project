## About 

This is a user-friendly, math-intensive program aimed at implementing the principles of the Hill Cipher in C++ code. 

## Method of Encryption/Decryption:
As stated above, SecroCryptr uses the Hill Cipher, which involves assigning each letter in the alphabet (other characters are
not supported) a numerical value and multiplying the characters in groups of 3 with a 3x3 matrix of randomly generated numbers.
